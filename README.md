# Dealership-SQL-Database
SQL Database for a Dealership.

I decided to create a car dealership database. That includes entities of customers, sales, vehicles, salespeople, dealership, and insurance. I chose these entities for the database for the reason that customers are primary buyers of vehicles, and the information is necessary for the dealership. Sales are needed as a transaction will take place between the dealership and the customer. This allows the dealership to track revenue and forecast and analyze sale patterns. Salespeople are the individuals who interact with customers, facilitate sales, and build relationships with customers. Their information and sales performance are important to track and manage the dealership's success. The dealership entity represents the dealership itself and includes information such as location, contact information, and financial information. Finally, insurance is a critical component of the car buying process and including this entity in the database allows for the tracking of insurance information for the vehicles sold by the dealership.
